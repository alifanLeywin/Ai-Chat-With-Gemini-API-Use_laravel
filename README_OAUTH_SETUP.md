# AI Chat with Google OAuth Setup

Your chat AI application has been successfully upgraded with Google OAuth login! Here's how to complete the setup:

## Features Added

✅ **Gmail Login System**: Users can now sign in with their Google accounts  
✅ **User Authentication**: All chat conversations are now tied to authenticated users  
✅ **Secure Sessions**: Each user only sees their own conversation history  
✅ **User Profile**: Display user name and avatar from Google account  
✅ **Logout Functionality**: Users can securely sign out  

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Google+ API** and **Google OAuth2 API**
4. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**
5. Set **Application type** to "Web application"
6. Add these **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   - `http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback`
   - `http://your-domain.com/auth/google/callback` (for production)

### 2. Environment Configuration

Update your `.env` file with the Google OAuth credentials:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback
```

### 3. Database Migration

The migrations have already been run, but if you need to run them again:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. User visits the application
2. If not authenticated, redirected to login page
3. User clicks "Continue with Google"
4. Google OAuth flow handles authentication
5. User is redirected back and logged in
6. Chat conversations are now tied to their account

### User Features
- **Personalized Experience**: Each user sees only their conversations
- **Profile Integration**: User's Google name and avatar are displayed
- **Secure Logout**: Clear session and return to login
- **Conversation History**: All chats are saved per user

### Routes Added
- `GET /login` - Login page
- `GET /auth/google` - Redirect to Google OAuth
- `GET /auth/google/callback` - Handle Google OAuth response
- `POST /logout` - Logout user

## Database Changes

### Users Table
- Added `google_id` (nullable, unique)
- Added `avatar` (nullable)
- Made `password` nullable (for OAuth-only users)

### Chat Conversations
- Added `user_id` foreign key
- Conversations now belong to specific users

## Security Features

- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
- **Authentication Middleware**: Chat routes require authentication
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own conversations
- **Secure Sessions**: Laravel's built-in session security

## Testing the Setup

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:8000`
3. You should be redirected to the login page
4. Click "Continue with Google"
5. Complete Google OAuth flow
6. You should be logged in and see the chat interface with your profile info

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid Client" Error**: 
- Check your Google Client ID and Secret are correct
- Verify the redirect URI matches exactly in Google Console

**"Redirect URI Mismatch"**:
- Make sure the redirect URL in your `.env` matches the one in Google Console
- Check for trailing slashes and exact URL matching

**Session Issues**:
- Clear browser cookies and try again
- Check that `SESSION_DRIVER=database` in your `.env`

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Update `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL` to your production domain
2. Add the production callback URL to Google Console
3. Set `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false`
4. Run `php artisan config:cache` after updating environment variables

## Support

The authentication system integrates seamlessly with your existing chat functionality. All your previous chat features remain intact, now with the added security and personalization of user accounts!
